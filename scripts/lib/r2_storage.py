"""Cloudflare R2 behind the shape of `supabase.storage`, for the Python harness.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The data plane already moved: `lib/turso_supabase_compat.py`
gives all 49 harness modules a Turso-backed `create_client`. But Turso is a
database, not an object store, so `.storage` was left as a `_Refuser` — correct
as a fail-closed default, wrong as a destination. Three runtime paths read bytes
out of Supabase Storage:

    integrations/send_gateway.py   shop-out attachments (the signed contract and
                                   the merchant's bank statements)
    integrations/extraction_consumer.py
                                   the SunBiz application PDF it extracts fields
                                   from
    ops/_supabase_backup.py        the SunBiz tenant export

Cancel Supabase with `.storage` still refusing and the first of those sends a
funder an email whose attachments are gone, the second marks every extraction
job failed, and the third writes a "backup" with no documents in it.

WHAT THIS IS. The same surface those callers already use, with supabase-py's
semantics rather than supabase-js's:

    storage.from_(bucket).download(path)                -> bytes  (RAISES on miss)
                         .upload(path, file, file_options)
                         .create_signed_url(path, expires_in)
                         .create_signed_upload_url(path)
                         .get_public_url(path)
                         .info(path)
                         .list(prefix, options)
                         .remove([paths])

supabase-py RAISES on a failed download (storage3.StorageException); supabase-js
returns `{data, error}`. This module follows PYTHON, because that is what the
call sites are written against — every one of them wraps the download in
`try/except` and treats an exception as the failure signal. Returning `None` or
`b""` here would turn a missing bank statement into a zero-byte attachment.

KEYS AND BUCKETS. One R2 bucket holds every Supabase bucket, namespaced by the
Supabase bucket name: `<supabase-bucket>/<path>` — the exact convention
`etl_storage_to_r2.py` uploaded 4,118 objects with, and the one
`lib/r2-storage.ts` writes new objects with in the four Next.js repos. So a
migrated object and a newly-written one land at the same key.

Reads and writes go to the PRIVATE bucket (oasis-storage), which holds every
object — `r2_split_public_bucket.py` COPIED the handful of public prefixes into
oasis-public and left the originals in place. Only `get_public_url` consults the
public bucket, and only for a prefix on the canonical public list; anything else
gets a short-lived presigned URL instead of a world-readable one. 4,088 of these
objects are merchant bank statements.

CREDENTIALS come from `etl_storage_to_r2._creds`, not from a fresh read of the
env here. The agents env spells the R2 key pair `cloudflare_Access_Key_ID` /
`cloudflare_Secret_Access_Key`, and that aliasing lives in one place. This
deliberately calls `_creds` rather than the `resolve_r2` wrapper: `resolve_r2`
also runs `provision_r2`, which creates buckets and toggles the managed r2.dev
domain over the Cloudflare API. That is a migration action. A cron job
downloading one PDF has no business creating buckets, and doing it on every
process start would put two API calls in front of every attachment read.
