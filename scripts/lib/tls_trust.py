"""tls_trust.py — one-call Windows/OS TLS trust setup for every network tool.

The 2026-07-17 CA-bundle lesson: on this Windows fleet, Python's bundled
certifi roots miss what the OS store has, so direct HTTPS calls die with
CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED (hit Supabase cron/heartbeat first, then
vercel_env_tool). The fix is the OS trust store via `truststore`, with a
certifi env-var fallback — but as of extraction it existed as four separate
inline copies (agent_heartbeat, cron_engine, email_validate_tool,
vercel_env_tool) while 30+ other HTTPS-calling scripts had none.

CANONICAL PATTERN for any script that talks HTTPS (requests/httpx/urllib):

    from lib.tls_trust import ensure_os_trust
    ensure_os_trust()   # call once, before the first network call

Behavior (mirrors agent_heartbeat._configure_ca_bundle, the fullest copy):
- Neutralizes a hostile/unusable SSLKEYLOGFILE (see below) — FIRST, because it
  breaks context construction itself, before any CA question is reached.
- Respects an operator override: if SSL_CERT_FILE or REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE is
  already set, does nothing.
- Prefers `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` (OS store — the real fix).
- Falls back to pointing SSL_CERT_FILE/REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE at certifi.
- Never raises; safe to call multiple times.

# ── SSLKEYLOGFILE poisoning (2026-07-29 outage) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The local AV (AVG) sets SSLKEYLOGFILE to a kernel device handle so its TLS
# scanner can log session keys:
#
#     SSLKEYLOGFILE=\\.\avgMonFltProxy\FFFF80838C28E160
#
# CPython's ssl.create_default_context() reads that var unconditionally and
# does `context.keylog_filename = <value>` (Lib/ssl.py). The handle is issued
# per AV session and goes STALE; opening it then raises PermissionError
# [Errno 13] / FileNotFoundError [Errno 2] — from inside SSL context
# construction, i.e. before a single byte is sent.
#
# PM2 makes this lethal rather than transient: the daemon captures the handle
# that was live when IT started and hands that frozen value to every child it
# spawns, forever. bravo-scheduler ran 25h on a dead handle, so every cron
# child that built an httpx/requests client died at construction —
# `Inbound Email Sweep` (31/145 runs), `Funnel Fast-Poll`, and, worst of all,
# notify.py itself, which meant the failures could not even be alerted on.
#
# We never want TLS session keys written to disk in production anyway (anyone
# holding that file can decrypt captured traffic), so the guard is aggressive:
# drop the var unless it points at a path we can actually append to, and let
# EMPIRE_ALLOW_SSLKEYLOG=1 opt back in for deliberate debugging.
